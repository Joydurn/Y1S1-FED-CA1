    <!--Intro paragraph-->
    <p>I grew up watching streaming services like Youtube in its early stages and loved how it gave opportunity for anyone to entertain others with videos. I have been trying my hand at video editing myself from time to time for a long time now. Starting with amateur software like Windows Movie Maker, and eventually learning to use adobe premiere pro. It was a fun experience learning just from toying around with the software. While I never made anything groundbreaking, I’m proud of being able to entertain friends and even strangers with some of my ‘hit’ videos. <strong>Check out my past projects here!</strong>

    <h1 id="speed"><br>SPEEDRUNNING</h1>
    <h2><em>“A speedrun is a play-through of a whole video game or a selected part of it (such as a single level), performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible.” ~Wikipedia Definition

    <p>I have a huge interest in video games in general, but one thing I’ve been getting into is speedrunning which is fairly niche. When I played Resident Evil 2, a survival horror game that I loved, I decided to get into the speedrunning community of the game (my first speedrun game). I did this by watching streamers on the platform Twitch who also speedran the game, learning from them and meeting many great people along the way.
    </p><br>
    <p>I made my way up the leaderboards on <a id="speedrun.com" href="https://www.speedrun.com">Speedrun.com</a>, a website where speedrunners of all games compete on leaderboards to get the best times (world records), share their knowledge, or ask questions. Check out my profile here!

    <p>Eventually, I started to stream my speedruns on Twitch, a video streaming platform catered to gamers. Now with poly life taking over more of my free time, I don't stream too frequently anymore, but it's still fun whenever I do.
